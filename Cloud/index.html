    <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Cloud computing is a transformative technology that allows users and organizations to access and manage
            data, applications, and services over the internet (the "cloud") rather than on local servers or personal
            devices.
        </li>
        <li>
            Essentially, it provides on-demand access to a shared pool of computing resources, such as servers, storage,
            databases, networking, software, and more, which can be quickly provisioned and released with minimal
            management effort or service provider interaction.
        </li>
        <li>
            Deployment models include Private Cloud, Public Cloud, and
            Hybrid Cloud.
        </li>
        <li>
            Service models include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
            Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            AWS is the worldâ€™s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud
            platform.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some common examples of cloud computing services include:

            Amazon Web Services (AWS)

            Microsoft Azure

            Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

            IBM Cloud
        </li>
        <li>
            Benefits of AWS include agility, elasticity, cost savings, and
            global deployment.
        </li>
